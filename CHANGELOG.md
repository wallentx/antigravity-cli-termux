# Antigravity CLI Changelog

<!-- disableFinding(LINE_OVER_80) -->

The terminal-first surface to interact with Antigravity agents. Stay in your flow without context switching.

## 1.2.10

- Added `medium` verbosity mode to `/config`, between `high` and `low`, which groups related tool calls and thoughts into concise summaries (such as `Explored N files`) while keeping commands and responses visible; the Verbosity setting and each option now describe what they show
- Improved Mermaid diagram and LaTeX rendering in the artifact viewer on Kitty-compatible terminals: artifacts are pre-rendered in the background so diagrams appear as soon as the viewer opens, images are uploaded once at a smaller size, and zooming with `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` no longer flickers between the old and new sizes
- Improved the artifact viewer footer by combining the separate top and bottom hints into one `g/G top/bottom` entry, labeling `m` with the view it switches to (diagram, LaTeX, ASCII, or raw), and fixing hints that contain arrow symbols wrapping onto a new line too early
- Improved terminal sandbox behavior so the agent asks to bypass the sandbox less often: it now knows sandboxed commands can read and write its own artifact and scratch directories, and it tries the sandbox first even after an earlier command needed a bypass
- Changed the step title of commands that exit with a non-zero code from `Errored` to `Failed`
- Changed how directory entries in `skills.json`, `rules.json`, `agents.json`, and `plugins.json` are scanned: an entry now loads only the items directly inside the directory, the same as a `.agents/skills/` folder, instead of recursively loading everything beneath it; to load a nested item, name it in `include_only`, for example `{"path": "shared_skills", "include_only": ["category/my-skill"]}`
- Fixed pressing `Esc` while the suggestions dropdown is open interrupting the agent's turn; it now closes the dropdown, and a second `Esc` interrupts
- Fixed Mermaid diagrams and LaTeX leaving a blank gap inside `tmux` or GNU `screen` when the outer terminal supports Kitty graphics; the CLI now falls back to ASCII diagrams unless images actually reach the terminal, and `CLI_GRAPHICS=kitty` still forces image mode for setups with image passthrough configured
- Fixed headless (`-p` / `--prompt`) runs that streamed part of a response and then ended on a model or agent error exiting with code 0; they now exit with code `3` and print the `AGY_ERROR` line, and JSON error output includes the partial response, while multi-turn `stream-json` sessions still warn and continue
- Fixed machines set up with the old Remote Control installer script crash-looping after an upgrade; when the CLI is launched by that deprecated background service it now unregisters the service and points to `remote-control start` instead of restarting repeatedly
- Fixed files that subagents write inside their own Git worktree being treated as artifacts, which demanded artifact metadata and left `.metadata.json` files in the worktree; subagent worktrees now live under a `worktrees/` directory in the app data directory

## 1.2.9

- Added `@<subagent> <message>` prompt syntax to send a message directly to a subagent conversation, with autocomplete listing running and completed subagents
- Added Vim numeric count multipliers so counts apply to operators, motions, and actions in Normal and Visual modes, including `3dw`, `2d3w`, `3dd`, `3x`, `3rX`, `3p`, `3u`, `[count]G`/`gg`/`$`, and counted text objects such as `2di(`
- Improved `GEMINI_API_KEY` sessions to reduce behavior discrepancies with the non-API-key sign-in path
- Improved the artifact viewer to show a Left/Right pan hint in the footer when a wide diagram overflows the window
- Improved `/rewind` to show a relative timestamp for each step and to focus the most recent step when the panel opens
- Improved command allow-listing suggestions to recognize `jj config` and `jj op` subcommands when offering to always allow a command
- Fixed headless (`-p` / `--prompt`) runs leaving daemon background processes running after exit, which could hang scripts reading the CLI's output until end-of-file; daemon processes now terminate when the run ends
- Fixed headless (`-p` / `--prompt`) runs cancelling still-running background tasks about 5 seconds after the agent went idle; runs now wait for background tasks until the `--print-timeout` deadline, up to a 30-minute cap
- Fixed a conversation-history database corruption risk where checking the database file for write access could silently drop file locks held by concurrent CLI processes on the same file
- Fixed context compaction failing when the tool configuration used for compaction checkpoints was rejected in certain scenarios
- Fixed a backend crash when a streamed model response chunk arrived without its response envelope, which terminated the session with connection errors
- Fixed markdown table column alignment when a table cell contains file links that wrap across lines
- Fixed markdown file links to code symbols dropping their display text and rendering the raw path instead
- Fixed incomplete enterprise sign-ins (for example closing the browser window before finishing license or project selection) leaving behind a stuck partial credential; such credentials are now cleared automatically so sign-in can be retried cleanly
- Fixed the browser companion page title to read `Antigravity CLI` instead of `Antigravity Cli`

## 1.2.8

- Improved context compaction to spread its user-request budget across all captured prompts, so a long initial instruction is no longer truncated to a small fixed slice when the other prompts in the conversation are short
- Improved context compaction to size summary and truncation budgets from the model's full context window instead of the compaction trigger threshold, so compacted summaries and background-task lists are no longer prematurely cut short
- Fixed PDF and audio tool outputs and attachments failing with `unsupported mime type` errors on custom models configured in `settings.json`; custom models now accept PDFs by default and honor the `modelFeatures` media flags for images, video, PDF, and audio
- Fixed pressing `Ctrl+G` to edit the prompt in a full-screen terminal editor such as `vim` hanging with `Vim: Warning: Output is not to a terminal`; external editors now run against a real terminal stdout
- Fixed voice dictation sessions longer than 4 minutes failing with a deadline error and erasing the drafted transcription; recordings now automatically stop and finalize at 3 minutes 30 seconds
- Fixed the startup banner displaying a Google Cloud Project ID for consumer (non-enterprise) sign-ins
- Fixed a stack-overflow crash when loading or compacting conversations containing background-task, subagent-management, messaging, or scheduling steps
- Fixed forked conversations inheriting step output data from steps after the fork point, which could collide with new steps produced in the fork
- Fixed a background poller and timer leaking for every conversation session, slowly accumulating memory over long-running sessions
- Fixed canceled conversation and workspace creation requests continuing to provision resources in the background; aborted requests now stop immediately
- Fixed quitting the CLI taking around 5 extra seconds before the process exited; shutdown now cancels open streaming connections immediately instead of waiting for a forced timeout

## 1.2.7

- Added inline Kitty graphics rendering for LaTeX math equations (`$$...$$` and fenced `math`, `latex`, and `tex` blocks) and Mermaid flowcharts and sequence diagrams in the artifact detail viewer, with Unicode ASCII fallback, Left/Right arrow horizontal panning for wide diagrams, and `m` to cycle between Image, ASCII, and Raw views
- Improved the `ask_question` interactive prompt with Left/Right arrow navigation between questions, inline previews of confirmed write-in answers, check marks on answered options, and single-step submission on the final question
- Improved the CLI startup banner for enterprise accounts to display the active Google Cloud Project ID beneath the signed-in account and plan tier
- Improved model API retry responsiveness by capping per-attempt retry backoff at 30 seconds instead of waiting up to 4 minutes between attempts
- Improved customization token budgeting by giving user and workspace rules a dedicated 20,000-token budget (cutting oversized rules on newline boundaries and listing over-budget rules by path and description) so large rule sets no longer evict skills, workflows, subagents, or MCP tools
- Improved the `/usage` panel by removing the duplicate remaining-quota percentage line beneath each progress bar
- Improved the default agent and subagent toolset by retiring the legacy `find_by_name`, `grep_search`, and `list_dir` tools from the default baseline while keeping them available to custom agents that explicitly list them in `tools`
- Fixed plugin skill slash commands being double-prefixed (`/<plugin>:<plugin>:<skill>`) when a skill's frontmatter name already includes the plugin prefix, or being shadowed when multiple plugins define skills with the same short name
- Fixed plugin upgrades leaving old MCP server and sidecar processes running from deleted install directories, and pruned superseded plugin versions and staging directories from the marketplace cache on startup
- Fixed disabled plugins disappearing from the `/plugin` list after enabled-only customization queries, and hardened plugin ID path validation on uninstall
- Fixed terminal rendering and Kitty keyboard protocol stack handling on exit and screen clear by upgrading Bubble Tea to v2.0.9
- Fixed headless (`-p` / `--prompt`) runs occasionally skipping the background-task waiting notice, logged background SDK tool progress to task log files, and reduced memory usage by cloning truncated command output previews
- Fixed starting the CLI unpinning conversations or marking them unread in the desktop app

## 1.2.6

- Added Remote Control (start a connection via `--remote-control` startup flag or `/remote-control` slash command) to create a session-scoped remote connection for following and controlling your active terminal session from another device. Typing `/remote-control off` or closing the session automatically tears down the tunnel and unregisters the device from the active Remote Control session list.
- Changed the default timeout for headless (`-p` / `--prompt`) runs from 5 minutes to unlimited so long-running agent turns run until the response completes unless `--print-timeout` is passed explicitly, and enabled daemon background commands in headless `GEMINI_API_KEY` sessions so background servers stay running after the turn finishes.
- Improved headless (`-p` / `--prompt`) error reporting when a turn terminates on an agent or model API failure: the CLI now prints a structured `AGY_ERROR: {...}` JSON line on stderr with canonical status, HTTP or gRPC error code, retryability, and error ID (including HTTP status mapping for `GEMINI_API_KEY` SDK errors) and exits with code `3` instead of `1`.
- Improved word-wise cursor movement (`Alt+F`, `Alt+B`, and `Ctrl`/`Alt`+Arrow keys) and word deletion (`Ctrl+W`, `Alt+Backspace`, and `Alt+D`) in the prompt editor to stop at punctuation boundaries instead of only whitespace, making it easy to step through or delete individual segments of file paths, URLs, and flags.
- Fixed turns triggered from a connected Remote Control session or running across secondary workspaces executing without the CLI session's active permission mode, cycle mode, and non-workspace file access grants.
- Fixed artifacts in the Remote Control companion rendering as plain `<name>.md` file links instead of rich artifact cards when the CLI's application data directory differs from the default bundle name.
- Fixed text selection in the full-screen artifact viewer capturing the line-number gutter and trailing padding; dragging across the viewer now highlights and copies only the document text, with `Ctrl+C` to re-copy an active selection, `Esc` to clear it, and `Shift`+drag for native terminal selection.
- Fixed submitting `/model <name> <prompt>` while a turn is already running switching the active model immediately in the middle of the in-flight turn; the one-shot model switch now waits until the queued prompt begins executing so the running turn and any earlier queued prompts finish on the session's original model.
- Fixed file edits with diffs larger than 1 MiB exceeding the conversation storage limit and force-clearing the session; oversized edits now preserve their line-change statistics while omitting the raw diff body from stored conversation history and skipping the elided diff during `/rewind` reverts.
- Fixed `/rewind` conversation reverts and forks sweeping backward to an older workspace snapshot when recent snapshot commits were skipped, which could silently overwrite kept work; snapshot lookup now sweeps forward from the target step and falls back to step-by-step revert replay when no later snapshot exists.

## 1.2.5

- Added automatic subagent guidance for custom agents defined in Markdown: agents that list `invoke_subagent` in their tools now receive the roster of available subagents and usage instructions in their system prompt, so they can actually delegate to the subagents they declared.
- Improved background task naming so a task keeps the name it was given when sent to the background; completion notifications and task lists now show that name instead of a generic auto-derived one.
- Fixed stale credentials lingering after the sign-in server definitively rejects them (for example a revoked or invalidated enterprise account); the CLI now signs you out and clears the stale tokens so you can sign in again cleanly, while temporary network failures, server errors, and rate limits never cost you your session.
- Fixed commands killed by an outside signal (for example when the whole session shuts down mid-run) being recorded as successful runs with exit code 0; such commands now finish as canceled while keeping the output collected before the interruption.
- Fixed the `Interrupted` hint only appearing when Esc was pressed locally in the terminal; it now appears whenever the current turn is actually cancelled, including when it is stopped from a connected remote session.
- Fixed the artifact viewer leaving markdown text stuck at its original width after a terminal resize; content now re-wraps to the new window size.
- Fixed in-progress thinking frames occasionally freezing permanently in the conversation history (for example showing `Thinking... (31s)` forever), including after a terminal resize or session reload.

## 1.2.4

- Added a `/skills reload` subcommand to asynchronously reload discovered skills and slash commands without restarting the session or blocking user input.
- Added an inline argument autocomplete dropdown when typing `/model` and a live fuzzy search bar inside the interactive `/model` picker to filter models by name or ID.
- Improved authentication error messages when OAuth tokens lack required scopes by including explicit instructions to run `/logout` and `/login`.
- Fixed mid-conversation model switching to Gemini thinking models failing with `thought_signature` validation errors when prior turns were generated by non-Gemini models.
- Fixed web search (`search_web`) failing with `"no summary returned from GenerateContent"` when the summarization model emits leading thought parts.
- Fixed agent turns terminating prematurely with `NO_TOOL_CALL` when a tool call fails schema validation, allowing the agent loop to return the validation error and self-correct.
- Fixed MCP tool schema augmentation mutating tool definitions in place, preventing strict argument validation failures.
- Fixed `hooks.json` configurations being silently dropped when customization token budget truncation is active.
- Fixed custom subagents losing configured `exclude` skill filters when runtime skill filtering is applied.
- Fixed subagent status and termination tracking under pubsub batch coalescing so killed subagents are not reset to active by late step updates.
- Fixed conversations with active turns or running daemon background tasks failing to auto-resume after a restart.
- Fixed terminal `ERROR` steps (such as failed tool executions or timeouts) being omitted from `transcript.jsonl` conversation logs.
- Fixed raw OSC 8 escape sequences rendering in `Apple_Terminal` over SSH connections by disabling unsupported hyperlink sequences.

## 1.2.3

- Added the `/copy btw` slash subcommand to copy the full text of the active `/btw` side-question response to the clipboard even when the response card is collapsed or scrolled, along with argument ghost hints when typing `/copy`.
- Improved tool-calling fidelity by translating per-request tool-choice constraints (`any`, `required`, and named functions) into native backend function-calling configurations.
- Fixed the `/hooks` command and hook inspection utilities omitting hooks bundled inside enabled plugins when listing active `hooks.json` configurations.
- Fixed custom subagents created with `enable_mcp_tools: true` receiving an empty MCP server list instead of inheriting the parent agent's configured MCP servers, and fixed declarative subagent configurations failing to resolve relative config file paths (`relative_path_to_config`) against the parent agent's directory.
- Fixed proactive feedback prompts triggering prematurely during the first few turns of a session or on transient, recovered tool errors.

## 1.2.2

- Improved the startup warning for deprecated `unsandboxed` permission rules across CLI, shared, and project configuration files to list each affected file path, up to five offending rules, and step-by-step instructions for migrating them to `command` rules.
- Improved `/resume` startup responsiveness when opening a large conversation history with a cold or stale summary cache.
- Fixed MCP servers bundled inside plugins colliding with each other or with user-configured servers in `mcp_config.json` when they shared the same server name by automatically namespacing plugin MCP servers as `<plugin>_<server>`.
- Fixed a memory leak where opening or scanning conversations left background step-cache eviction goroutines running for the rest of the session, significantly reducing memory usage after opening `/resume` or switching conversations.
- Fixed `view_file` attempting to parse non-UTF-8 binary files as text or loading files larger than 100 MB into the model context; unsupported binary formats and oversized files are now rejected with a clear error before overflowing the context window.
- Fixed Gemini API (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) sessions dropping model thinking blocks from prior turns on subsequent user messages and failing to propagate thought signatures on text and thought parts.
- Fixed artifact review failing to trigger when a directory name above `.gemini/` matched a skipped path component such as `scratch`, prevented conversation forks and snapshot reverts from copying internal `.system_generated/subagents` and `.system_generated/worktrees` directories, and cleaned up subagent metadata records when deleting a conversation.
- Fixed deleted conversations being recreated as empty, schema-less SQLite database files when background queries reconnected after deletion.
- Fixed conversations launched without a workspace folder inheriting workspace paths and customizations from other open sessions.

## 1.2.1

- Added support for `excludeDefaultComponents: true` in custom agent Markdown frontmatter, allowing custom agents to opt out of default prompt sections and built-in tools while preserving post-invocation hooks.
- Improved model API error resilience and diagnostics: transient `genai.APIError` failures (`502`, `503`, `504`, per-minute `429` rate limits, and mid-stream interruptions) automatically retry in-process with exponential backoff while preserving completed tool call outputs, and unrecovered `503` and `429` responses surface clear user-facing error messages.
- Improved MCP and provider tool schema validation to preserve open object schemas (such as `{"type": "object"}` or explicit `additionalProperties: true`) instead of rejecting undeclared arguments on schemas that allow them.
- Improved per-turn responsiveness and reduced memory usage when opening large conversations.
- Fixed `--continue` starting a brand-new conversation when launched from a subdirectory, after a crash, or while another session is open in the same workspace; it now falls back to the most recent non-empty conversation in the current workspace or its parent/child directories.
- Fixed full-screen blank flashes in inline mode when content first pushes to scrollback, at the end of a turn, or when clearing the screen with `Ctrl+L`.
- Fixed remote companion UIs connected to an interactive CLI session via Remote Control displaying an unauthenticated sign-in screen instead of the active session's signed-in state.
- Fixed the status line reporting the terminal sandbox as disabled when the session was launched with the `--sandbox` command-line flag.
- Fixed image zoom keys (`Ctrl+=` and `Ctrl+-`) and the footer zoom hint appearing in the artifact viewer when a Mermaid diagram is rendered in ASCII mode instead of as a Kitty image.

## 1.2.0

- Added the `remote-control start`, `remote-control status`, and `remote-control stop` subcommands to run the CLI as a background service registered with your operating system's service manager so your machine stays reachable across logouts and reboots; `remote-control start --name <label>` sets a custom machine label in the Remote Control instance list, and `--session` scopes the service to your active login session.
- Improved half-page scrolling across all scrollable views — including altscreen mode, the diff viewer, and read-only detail panels where `ctrl+d` no longer triggers the exit prompt — and set `shift+up` and `shift+down` as customizable default keybindings for half-page navigation (`navigation.half_page_up` and `navigation.half_page_down`).
- Fixed prompts or model responses blocked by content safety filters failing with a spurious "no candidate found" error, ending silently with an empty turn, or repeatedly retrying the rejected input; the CLI now surfaces a clear content-filter stop reason.
- Fixed temporary working files written to the agent `scratch/` directory triggering recursive filesystem watchers and appearing as noisy entries in the artifact review panel and checkpoints.
- Fixed MCP servers bundled inside globally installed plugins failing to initialize at CLI startup or failing to update their running status when plugins are enabled or disabled.
- Fixed third-party MCP server tools failing schema validation when their input schemas omit `additionalProperties`.
- Fixed unnecessary filesystem customization discovery walks running on every user message even when no slash command is invoked, reducing latency before the agent begins responding.
- Fixed every log line in `cli.log` and background daemon subcommand output being prefixed with a spurious `ERROR: logging before google.Init` message.
- Fixed the macOS `remote-control` background service terminating shortly after startup when launched by the system service manager, `remote-control start` and `remote-control stop` leaving legacy installer-script background services running, and the Remote Control setting being unavailable when your access comes from a paid Google Cloud project.
- Fixed older conversations failing to load with an `unknown step type` error when resumed.

## 1.1.28

- Improved resilience to transient model API errors: the agent now retries errors such as `503 Unavailable` for much longer with exponential backoff, so a brief service hiccup no longer aborts your session.
- Improved sign-in and startup speed by reading your signed-in identity from the stored credential instead of making a network request on every launch and after browser consent; a failed identity lookup no longer prevents sign-in from completing, and the displayed plan tier no longer briefly disappears during startup.
- Improved headless (`-p`) runs to exit promptly once the final answer is delivered: the CLI waits for running background tasks and scheduled timers to finish, bound by `--print-timeout`, and leaves daemon background tasks such as dev servers running instead of terminating them.
- Improved failure reporting in headless (`-p`) runs: fatal errors now appear on stderr with a stable `error:` marker, a note is printed when the response may be truncated, and runs that previously ended silently with no output now explain why.
- Improved headless (`-p`) turnaround by cutting up to 200 ms of idle latency per turn and skipping the model call that generated a conversation title no one would see.
- Improved tool approval prompts to say exactly what you are approving — for example `Run this command?`, `Allow access to this URL?`, or `Allow calling this tool?` — with the command-editing shortcut offered only when a command is being approved, and a `Reason:` line explaining why approval is being requested when it is not obvious, such as a hook flagging the action or a file belonging to a different project.
- Improved model selection auditability: the CLI log now records whenever a model name you specify resolves to a different model, such as alias resolution, `--effort` variant selection, or replacement of a deprecated saved model.
- Changed what happens when `--print-timeout` expires mid-turn: the CLI now returns the partial output it has and exits successfully with a warning on stderr, instead of failing with a timeout error; interrupts such as Ctrl+C still exit non-zero.
- Changed the default permission for fetching URLs from always allowed to asking first, so the agent now requests approval before reading a URL unless you have granted access.
- Fixed plugin reinstalls keeping files that had been deleted from the source: installing a plugin now replaces its managed directory exactly, installing a plugin from its own installed directory is refused instead of corrupting it, and uninstalling a plugin no longer leaves its enabled/disabled entry behind in `config.json`.
- Fixed MCP servers defined by plugins resolving relative or unset working directories against the wrong location; they now resolve against the plugin's own directory so plugin-bundled scripts run correctly.
- Fixed a startup race where subagents could fail to find tools from MCP servers that were still initializing.
- Fixed subagents sometimes appearing stuck in a running state after they had finished — especially in very large conversations — which also left queued when-idle messages undelivered until restart.
- Fixed a memory leak where every finished terminal command kept internal state alive for the rest of the session; long sessions that run many commands now use significantly less memory.
- Fixed headless (`-p`) runs stalling forever on implementation-plan approval that no one could give; non-interactive runs now proceed through plan review automatically.
- Fixed sign-in failing with a project access error after switching from a business account with a selected project to a personal account; stale business project and license details are now fully cleared on personal sign-in.

## 1.1.27

- Added `/model <name> <prompt>`, which runs a single prompt on another model and then returns the session to the model it was using, so you can consult a different model mid-conversation without disturbing your saved default.
- Added a `conversation_title` field to the JSON payload passed to custom status line and window title scripts, so they can show the active conversation's name and pick up renames immediately.
- Added an `agents` list to custom agent Markdown frontmatter, letting an agent declare the subagents it depends on using the same workspace-relative, absolute, and agent-relative path rules as `skills`.
- Improved `/model` to show a `[model]` argument hint as you type, so the command's arguments are discoverable without opening help.
- Improved the `/settings` panel so each Verbosity option explains itself as you highlight it, describing whether tool calls, commands, and thoughts are shown in full or collapsed into a token metrics table.
- Improved the sign-in and Google Cloud setup screens to use the CLI's standard styled key hints, which follow your color scheme and keybindings and drop the navigation hint when only one option is available.
- Changed `/model <name>` to report `Model already set to <name>` when the session is already using that model, instead of reporting a switch that did not happen.
- Fixed tool calls to MCP servers accepting arguments the server's own schema never declared, so an invented parameter is now rejected and corrected instead of being silently dropped.
- Fixed headless runs with `-p` silently skipping tool actions they were not permitted to take, which now end with a notice naming the refused actions and report them as `denied_actions` in the JSON output.
- Fixed `?` in Vim Normal mode opening the shortcuts panel while the prompt already contained text, so character-search and replace operators such as `f?`, `t?`, and `df?` work; `?` still opens shortcuts on an empty prompt.
- Fixed `/model` with no argument doing nothing when run before the session had finished starting up, so it now opens the model picker.
- Fixed print mode (`-p`) exiting before the session finished shutting down, which could drop the run's trailing conversation history before it reached disk.
- Fixed a redundant approval prompt when the agent reads or writes another conversation's artifact files after you have already allowed access to files outside your workspace.

## 1.1.26

- Added half-page scrolling with `Ctrl+D` and `Ctrl+U` to the artifact viewer.
- Added the `pickerGrouping` setting to `/config` and `settings.json` to configure the default conversation list view in `/resume` (flat or grouped by workspace).
- Improved terminal ASCII diagram rendering for Mermaid flowcharts in the artifact viewer and conversation.
- Improved `/logout` execution time by short-circuiting token removal directly to file storage when keyring storage is bypassed or unreachable.
- Changed unselected model families in the interactive `/model` picker to default to medium reasoning effort instead of low.
- Fixed subagent tasks unexpectedly prompting for tool approval in always-proceed mode while viewing the subagent details panel.
- Fixed orphaned Git worktrees accumulating on disk under `.system_generated/worktrees` when killing subagents or deleting conversations.
- Fixed SQLite database WAL checkpointing on CLI exit so trailing session metadata updates are flushed to disk before shutdown.
- Fixed customization discovery logging spurious errors when accessing temporary directories or paths outside the active workspace.

## 1.1.25

- Added an opt-in workspace-grouped view to the `/resume` conversation picker, allowing users to toggle between a flat list and conversations grouped by directory with `Ctrl+F`.
- Added Gemini 3.8 Flash to the model catalog when connecting with a `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Changed custom agents defined in Markdown to inherit ambient skills, rules, and subagents by default, matching the configuration of default agents.
- Fixed MCP OAuth authentication failing when authorization servers return authorization codes longer than 1024 characters.
- Fixed skill path matching and grouping in the `/skills` panel on Windows where host path separators (`\`) caused global and workspace skills to be misclassified.
- Fixed relative path resolution in Markdown-defined custom agents so relative subagent and plugin paths resolve correctly against the agent definition's directory.
- Fixed duplicate permission grants accumulating in configuration settings across session reloads and subagent invocations.
- Fixed /boost failing at runtime by improving worker tool configurations.
- Fixed a fatal nil pointer crash in the agent runtime caused by background summary updates attempting to read cached steps after trajectory closure.
- Hardened Remote Control reverse-tunnel routing.

## 1.1.24

- Improved `/mcp` panel navigation so up and down arrow keys strictly navigate between MCP servers and plugins, left and right arrow keys cycle available actions, and `Esc` exits action mode or the panel.
- Fixed duplicate agent entries appearing in the `/agents` picker when an agent with the same name is discovered across multiple configuration sources or plugins.
- Fixed tool initialization and agent startup failing when launched from an inaccessible or deleted working directory by using absolute URI schemes for in-memory parameter schemas.
- Fixed headless CLI invocations with piped standard output or standard error hanging on exit by setting `FD_CLOEXEC` on the preserved streams so child processes do not keep the caller's pipes open.
- Fixed MCP configuration parsing failing when `mcp_config.json` contains single-line (`//`) comments, multi-line (`/* */`) comments, or trailing commas.
- Fixed orphaned annotation files accumulating in local storage when deleting conversations.
- Fixed `/btw` side questions in conversations with an active `/goal` being forced to continue and making unintended tool calls.

## 1.1.23

- Improved `/model <name>` autocompletion to accept the proposed model name ghost text with `Tab`.
- Reduced subagent streaming overhead by sending subagent trajectory metadata once per subtrajectory instead of with every step.
- Fixed commands with subcommands (such as `models` or `agents`) hanging on an inherited, unclosed standard input pipe instead of executing immediately.
- Fixed CLI crashes caused by prompt hooks by catching hook panics and rejecting nil completion configurations in model requests.
- Fixed tool invocations and results omitting tool-call IDs when reconstructing request history for Gemini models.
- Fixed tool permission prompts for direct and MCP tool calls displaying generic prompt titles instead of their declared human-readable action descriptions.
- Fixed unconfigured or interrupted Google Cloud authentication and onboarding sessions dropping into broken chat sessions instead of prompting with the sign-in screen.
- Fixed transient authentication errors caused by token expiry clock skew by proactively refreshing browser and WIF OAuth tokens five minutes before expiration.
- Fixed instructional cycle mode placeholders reappearing in the input prompt after typing and clearing content.
- Fixed subagents defined with `enable_mcp_tools=true` failing with unknown tool errors by ensuring the MCP dispatcher meta-tool is available to the subagent executor.
- Fixed prompts entered immediately after login being discarded with an account verification alert by queueing them until background eligibility verification completes.
- Fixed cancelled or killed subagents remaining stuck in the "Running" state in the UI task drawer across ancestor conversations.
- Fixed parsing MCP JSON configuration files on Windows when saved with a UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM).

## 1.1.22

- Added a `/model <name>` argument that switches to a model by name, slug or label and saves it as your default in one step, with the rest of the first matching name offered as ghost text while you type; `/model` on its own still opens the picker, and an unrecognized name prints the valid ones.
- Improved the `/effort` hint so it completes what you have actually typed instead of always showing a fixed `[low|medium|high]` placeholder.
- Improved artifact handling in conversations that produce many files by coalescing bursts of filesystem events into a single rescan.
- Fixed selectable reasoning effort for Gemini 3.1 Pro and Gemini 3.5 Flash when you authenticate with a Gemini API key.
- Fixed the interface redrawing continuously while the tasks panel or a subagent detail panel was open with nothing running, which held process CPU near 32% instead of the roughly 10% it now settles at.
- Fixed a running subagent's elapsed timer freezing on screen whenever the parent agent was itself waiting.
- Fixed an HTTP 502 from the model endpoint ending the whole run instead of being retried, so a transient bad gateway is now treated as the temporary outage it is.
- Fixed a `self` subagent launched from a conversation with no recorded agent configuration re-resolving its setup from scratch and drifting from its parent, most visibly by running interactively when the parent was in autonomous mode.
- Fixed file deletions failing on Windows with a sharing violation while another process still held the file open, which is now retried with backoff for about a second before reporting failure.
- Fixed headless daemon printing an `Open in your browser: http://localhost:<port>` line in its startup banner, which was never a supported way to connect and, under a service manager, was written to the log on every restart.
- Fixed the built-in `migrate-workflows` skill assuming POSIX home directories and path separators, so it now resolves and reports paths correctly on Windows.

## 1.1.21

- Added `/voice` dictation, which transcribes speech straight into the prompt; press `f5` or run `/voice` to start and stop it, and use the `mic-serve` subcommand to forward a local microphone to a CLI running on another machine over SSH. Only one live dictation stream is allowed per account, and a second one now says so instead of reporting an exhausted quota.
- Added a `cost` field to the status line data model, exposing the unrounded estimated cost of the current session so a custom status line can display running token spend.
- Improved the agent's code search by running an embedded `ripgrep` binary instead of shelling out to whatever the machine provides, so searches are faster and behave identically on systems with no `ripgrep` installed.
- Improved the `always-proceed` permission mode to auto-approve MCP tool calls and page reads as well, which kept prompting even though the mode exists to run without interruptions.
- Improved allow-always permission suggestions for script runners such as `npm run`, `yarn`, `pnpm` and `cargo run` by pinning the specific script name, so approving `npm run dev` no longer grants every script in the project.
- Improved conversation titles by generating them automatically when a conversation is created, so the resume picker shows a meaningful name instead of a placeholder from the first message.
- Improved the error shown when an MCP server configured for Google credentials cannot find Application Default Credentials.
- Fixed corrupted edits to files containing non-ASCII text such as CJK characters, accented letters or emoji, where an inexact match was spliced at the wrong offset and produced invalid UTF-8.
- Fixed the session stalling mid-response when a tool result or file diff contained invalid UTF-8, which broke the agent state stream and left the interface waiting indefinitely.
- Fixed a file write being reported as a failure after the content had already been written to disk, which sent the agent into unnecessary retries on large files such as notebooks.
- Fixed explicitly configured skill and plugin paths losing to customizations discovered automatically nearby, so a path you set in your configuration now wins a name collision.

## 1.1.20

- Added skill icon and visual branding support across the CLI, displaying emoji icons declared under `metadata.icon` in `SKILL.md` frontmatter across the `/skills` catalog list view, detail inspection headers, and slash command autocompletion popups, with proper multi-byte Unicode display width calculation to maintain terminal layout alignment.
- Improved `@` file path autocompletion by indexing empty directories alongside files in ripgrep search results, allowing unpopulated and directory-only workspace structures to be discovered and traversed during path completion.
- Improved permission management by automatically granting workspace-scoped read access under the default review mode, eliminating repetitive approval prompts for reading or listing files within the workspace root while strictly maintaining confirmation prompts for file modifications and external access.
- Improved Git repository inspection performance by skipping recursive submodule worktree scans while continuing to track commit pointer updates to eliminate status latency in repositories with submodules.
- Fixed print mode (`-p`/`--print`, including `--output-format json` and `stream-json`) treating benign tool execution errors and permission denials as fatal run failures with non-zero exit codes, ensuring headless exit codes reflect only cascade-level failures and match interactive session behavior.
- Fixed the CLI overwriting and discarding unparsed configuration in `settings.json` when encountering an unrecognized setting value or syntax error on startup, preserving the existing configuration file on disk instead of saving a truncated version.
- Fixed `/skills`, `/plugins`, `/agents`, and `/hooks` commands reporting that no customizations were found when invoked without an explicit agent configuration by mounting built-in customizations in listing views.
- Fixed CJK draft jitter in the main prompt by normalizing boundary whitespace in streaming transcript updates, preventing unwanted spaces from being inserted characters.
- Fixed the conversation spinner animation loop continuing to tick indefinitely in the background after turns completed, eliminating unnecessary CPU wakeups while the CLI is idle.

## 1.1.19

- Fixed `--remote-control` refusing to start whenever port was taken, so it now takes a free port from the operating system.
- Added the `AGY_CLI_HIDE_LOGO` environment variable for narrow terminals, screen readers and recordings where the banner's logo art gets in the way; setting it suppresses the art while keeping the version and account lines.
- Added `AGY_CLI_DISABLE_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE_OPTIMIZATIONS` to bypass the renderer's dirty-rectangle and diffing optimizations.

## 1.1.18

- Added support for passing a project name to `--project`, which previously accepted only a project ID and failed on anything else.
- Added `item.rename` and `item.delete` keybindings for the conversation picker's rename and delete actions, so `f2` and `f4` can be rebound in `keybindings.json` on keyboards without function keys.
- Improved `@` file path completion with a typo-tolerant fallback, so a query with a transposed or mistyped character still finds the file; typo matches never outrank exact ones.
- Improved audio attachments by recognizing the standard formats Gemini models accept, including `wav`, `mp3`, `m4a`, `aac`, `flac` and `opus`, which were previously refused as unsupported.
- Improved keystroke responsiveness on Windows by discarding the key-release events the console reports and nothing in the CLI reads, which were roughly doubling the rendering work per keystroke.
- Improved the artifact viewer footer by moving the outline shortcut next to the scroll and page hints, so the three ways to move through a document read as one group.
- Fixed print mode (`-p`) exiting successfully with an empty response when the agent state stream was dropped mid-run, which reported a failed turn as a clean success; it now surfaces the stream error and exits non-zero.
- Fixed a valueless prompt flag swallowing the next flag as its prompt, so `--print --sandbox 'do the task'` no longer runs with the prompt `--sandbox` and the sandbox off; both that and a stray trailing argument are now errors.
- Fixed an expanded `/btw` card pushing the footer hints and the prompt off-screen on a long answer, which is now clamped to the terminal height and scrollable with the arrow and page keys.
- Fixed `/resume` opening below the fold instead of on the workspace you are working in, which happened whenever the CLI ran from a subdirectory of that workspace.
- Fixed text losing its styling for the rest of a line after a file link, where the link's own reset also reset the surrounding prose.
- Fixed a stray character appearing in the prompt every couple of seconds on terminals that print the CLI's periodic input-mode re-arming as literal text; the re-arm now happens only inside a terminal multiplexer, which is the only thing that resets those modes behind the CLI's back.

## 1.1.17

- Improved the agent execution harness by consolidating onto a single execution path, giving more consistent tool, hook, and prompt behavior.
- Fixed `/teamwork-preview` and some other slash commands disappearing for some users.
- Fixed `Enter` not opening an active background task or subagent while the prompt was in Vim insert mode.
- Fixed attaching Ogg audio and video files such as `.ogg`, `.opus` and `.ogv`, which the model rejected because they were sent as the generic `application/ogg`.

## 1.1.16

- Added `mcp` subcommands (`add`, `remove`, `list`, `enable`, `disable`) for managing MCP servers in your user-level `mcp_config.json` without hand-editing it, covering both stdio and HTTP servers through `--type`, `--env` and `--header`.
- Improved `@` file path completion in large workspaces by running the lookup through the bundled `ripgrep` and debouncing keystrokes, and by ranking a file whose name matches your query above a directory or generated artifact that merely contains it.
- Improved `/effort` so it adjusts reasoning effort for Gemini 3.6 Flash and Gemini 3.7 Flash when you sign in with a Gemini API key, a route that previously reported those models as not adjustable even though the same models were adjustable on every other sign-in path.
- Fixed links printing as raw escape sequences on terminals that do not implement OSC 8 hyperlinks, such as Terminal.app, and extended the same detection to command output and alert bodies, which still emitted hyperlinks unconditionally.
- Fixed a `=` character accumulating in the prompt every couple of seconds on terminals that do not implement the Kitty keyboard protocol, where the renderer's periodic re-arming of that protocol was printed as literal text instead of being interpreted.
- Fixed `@` file path completion showing files that were in your `.antigravityignore`.
- Fixed the artifact list showing a percent-escaped filename such as `quarterly%20plan.md` for artifacts whose name contains a space, so the list row, the inline preview and the detail header all spell the name the same way.
- Fixed the prompt editor's cursor becoming misaligned when text wrapped.
- Fixed the `/mcp` panel dropping `enabledTools`, `timeoutSeconds`, `url` and `tools.eager` from `mcp_config.json` when you toggled a server on or off; it now preserves any field it does not recognize, so configuration written by a newer client survives an edit.
- Fixed `read_resource` discarding non-image binary content returned by an MCP server, which now offloads every blob to disk and inlines only small text and image resources, so large PDFs, audio and other binary resources are usable instead of silently dropped.
- Fixed Workforce Identity Federation sign-in signing you out roughly every hour, because the token refresh went to the standard sign-in endpoint rather than the federated one.
- Fixed skills that ship with the CLI being reported as not built-in, so the `builtin` flag in the `/skills` listing under `--output-format json` is accurate and the `/skills` panel groups them correctly.
- Fixed the reasoning-effort description under the timeline gauge in the `/effort` and `/model` pickers overflowing on narrow terminals, where it is now omitted so the gauge stays readable.
- Fixed `/btw` failing with a planner configuration error in conversations driven by a custom or SDK-defined agent, so side questions work regardless of which agent you are running.
- Fixed a failed `/btw` side question always reporting `model returned an empty response`, which was a hardcoded guess rather than the real failure; the card now shows the side question's own error when there is one.
- Fixed the status line, the active-items list and the `/tasks` panel continuing to show background tasks that had already finished.
- Fixed the CLI overwriting a `settings.json` it could not parse with default settings, which silently reverted every setting the next time anything was saved; a refused save now leaves the file byte-identical so you can repair it by hand, and the status line names the file.
- Fixed a subagent whose definition leaves `model` at `inherit` failing to start when the parent agent has no model of its own, which now falls back to the default fast tier.

## 1.1.15

- Added `--input-format stream-json` to print mode, which reads newline-delimited JSON prompts from stdin and runs one turn per message in a single conversation, so a driver can keep a session open.
- Added a `rules:` key to markdown agent frontmatter, so an agent can name rule files directly instead of inheriting your whole rule tree; a rule named this way always applies.
- Added plugin support for a top-level `rules.json`, so a plugin can declare the rule files it ships the same way it already declares its skills.
- Added a more specific hint on the spinner line, which now names the tool call the agent is currently running.
- Fixed the CLI aborting at startup on hosts that preload their own allocator through `LD_PRELOAD`, such as Cloud TPU VM images, where it died before the interface appeared.
- Fixed personal accounts hitting a resource-exhausted error at startup when saved credentials were restored from the system keyring, and cut the repeated account checks that followed.
- Fixed your billing project, and the license tier it selects, being lost when the CLI restarted and restored saved credentials from the system keyring.
- Fixed a spurious "Out of credits" message for enterprise users signed in through Application Default Credentials.
- Fixed the `/model` picker cutting off models, and its own header, on terminals too short to show every model; the list now scrolls.
- Fixed the `/model` picker misaligning its columns for model names that are not plain ASCII, by measuring column widths in display cells rather than bytes.
- Fixed the spinner line flickering to a generic label between quick tool calls.
- Fixed streamed text corrupting non-ASCII characters into replacement characters, in both the interactive display and `--output-format stream-json` text deltas.
- Fixed artifacts written into a subdirectory of a conversation's artifact directory, such as `scratch/`, never appearing in the artifact list.
- Fixed reading a `.wav` file failing as an unsupported media type, by normalizing non-canonical MIME types such as `audio/wave` before they reach the model.

## 1.1.14

- Added a faster return path for enterprise sign-in, so a returning user is offered a single `Continue with ...` option naming the method they last used.
- Added support for OAuth client ID metadata documents when connecting to an MCP server, so servers implementing that part of the specification no longer require a manually supplied client ID or dynamic client registration.
- Improved the `/context` panel, which is now scrollable and sized to the terminal. `/usage` is sized the same way.
- Improved markdown-defined agents with a single `inheritCustomizations` switch that decides whether the agent adopts your skills, rules, plugins, subagents and MCP servers, replacing per-kind defaults that silently disagreed with each other.
- Improved the setting that allows access outside your workspace, which now grants only read access; writes are auto approved according to the cycle mode setting.
- Fixed the CLI exiting silently when its language server failed, both at startup and while running; the failure is now printed to the terminal and the process exits non-zero instead of reporting success.
- Fixed the sign-in URL and other links rendering as garbled text on terminals that do not parse OSC 8 hyperlinks, such as GNU `screen`, which are now detected and given plain text instead.
- Fixed `Enter` being swallowed while the path-suggestion popup was still loading, which sent the prompt and then popped the results open on top of it.
- Fixed the artifact list marking every earlier artifact as approved when reopened, so artifacts that were unreviewed, commented on or rejected in a previous turn keep their real status.
- Fixed one malformed entry in your MCP configuration bringing down every other server, which is now logged and skipped so the remaining servers still load.
- Fixed built-in skills, rules and plugins disappearing from an agent that set `inherit_user` to false, which was only meant to opt out of your personal customizations, not the ones shipped with the CLI.
- Fixed reverting or branching a long conversation failing with `too many SQL variables`.
- Fixed a long conversation's title jumping to an unrelated older message once history was truncated, by protecting the checkpoint the title is derived from.
- Fixed a multi-line paste submitting one prompt per line on terminals that do not honour bracketed paste.

## 1.1.13

- Added support for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, so the CLI can run against the Gemini API directly without signing in. Set `modelProvider: "gemini"` in `settings.json`, export `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and point `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` at a custom endpoint if you need one. The banner and `/help` show `Gemini API key` as the credential, and `/logout` explains that it comes from the environment rather than appearing to end a session.
- Improved `/codesearch` resilience by falling back to a local search when the `ripgrep` binary cannot be executed, such as when an endpoint security agent blocks it.
- Improved artifact list scrolling by caching each file's preview line count, which previously re-read every listed file from disk on every keypress.
- Improved custom agent support by making `manage_task` available to declarative agents that have not opted out of fundamental components, so a custom agent can list and kill its own background tasks, and reworded its step lines to read `Killed task X` and `Checked task X`.
- Improved `search_web` steps by showing the query while the search is still running rather than only after it returns.
- Improved the agent's behavior after backgrounding work by removing the anti-polling reminder text from the `manage_task` and `manage_inbox` tool results, which could itself nudge the model into a polling loop.
- Improved the `/resume` picker by relabeling its second tab, which previously carried a name that did not distinguish it from the first.
- Improved deleting a conversation from the `/resume` picker by moving the keybinding from `ctrl+delete` to `f4`, since macOS terminals disagree on how they report the delete key and the old binding silently did nothing there.
- Improved the time to open a large conversation by loading step headers in batches and no longer reading each step's full payload just to read its type.
- Improved embedded ripgrep reliability and security by saving extracted binaries to the user cache directory instead of /tmp. Added content-addressed SHA-256 verification and atomic renaming to guarantee binary integrity and prevent concurrent execution races.
- Fixed a distorted startup banner in Cloud Shell, where the web terminal mishandles the cursor-optimization escape sequences the renderer emits; a conservative rendering mode now turns on automatically there.
- Fixed the direct Gemini API route parking on the sign-in screen instead of booting straight into the main UI, and fixed model requests failing against a custom endpoint set through `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` by dropping a session field such an endpoint is not guaranteed to support.
- Fixed conversations disappearing from the `/resume` picker after cycling to the second tab and back, which left it reporting `No conversations available`, and kept the `tab` hint in the shortcut bar even when a tab is empty.
- Fixed trajectory truncation destroying nearly all of a long conversation's history, by charging the size budget only against steps whose bytes can actually be reclaimed instead of against protected checkpoints and the unreclaimable residue of already-cleared steps.
- Fixed unbounded growth of the on-disk conversation database in sessions woken by background tasks, subagents or agent messages, where each wake appended duplicate grants and settings to every persisted row.
- Fixed corruption of the saved transcript when a background message appended to it while context compaction was rewriting it, which left malformed JSON that no longer parsed.
- Fixed a hung sandbox setup killing the rest of the conversation, where the step was never unregistered so every later message was silently swallowed and the session appeared dead until a restart.
- Fixed `define_subagent` using a model-supplied agent name directly as a directory name, so a name containing `..` could write its `agent.md` outside the conversation's artifact directory; names are now validated at both the tool and the handler.
- Fixed artifact list rendering, where previews produced garbled text and overflowed the panel on wide CJK or emoji characters, the cursor could point past the end of the list when entries disappeared, and the header and footer lines were left out of the scroll math so the list overflowed its viewport.
- Fixed `Esc` in the artifact viewer showing a spurious submit confirmation for reviews that had completed in earlier turns, and fixed submitting re-reporting those same reviews.
- Fixed `invoke_subagent`, `send_message`, `manage_subagents`, `define_subagent`, and `generate_image` rendering with no tool call line at all in collapsed and expanded tool groups, leaving a bare `(ctrl+o to expand)` hint with no tool name.

## 1.1.12

- Added a heading outline to the artifact viewer, opened with `t`, so a long markdown document's structure is visible at a glance and you can jump straight to a section instead of scrolling.
- Added non-interactive answers for more read-only slash commands in print mode, so `-p "/permissions"`, `/hooks`, `/help`, `/changelog` and `/config` each emit one tab-separated record per line — or a structured payload under `--output-format json` and `stream-json` — without starting an agent turn, spending quota or leaving a conversation behind, with `/help` listing exactly the commands print mode answers and `/changelog` printing the release notes.
- Added machine-readable output to the `models` and `agents` subcommands through an `--output-format` flag accepting `json` and `stream-json`, and moved their error messages and progress spinner off stdout so captured output contains only the list.
- Added a `disable-slash-command: true` flag for a skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter, which hides that skill from the `/` menu and from `/name` resolution while leaving it discoverable and invocable by the model, so a large skill library no longer floods the command menu.
- Added rendering for alert callouts (`[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]`, `[!CAUTION]`) and for carousel blocks in markdown artifacts, which previously showed as raw markup.
- Improved terminal hyperlink support, enabling clickable links over SSH and in hyperlink-capable `tmux`, keeping word-wrapped URLs clickable past their first line, linking URLs that the markdown renderer had left as plain text including ones inside code blocks, no longer highlighting unrelated links together on hover, and fixing horizontal scrolling and text selection on lines that contain a link.
- Improved tool call headers so every native and MCP tool call carries a short summary of what it is doing instead of a bare name or a raw argument blob, with the same summary naming background tasks and subagents in the activity list and the matching action phrase describing the request in permission prompts.
- Improved headroom for large toolsets by raising the per-session limit on tool declarations, so heavy MCP, plugin and skill setups stop being rejected for having too many tools.
- Improved sign-in with Application Default Credentials by resolving the quota project automatically, so service-account logins work without extra configuration.
- Improved repository detection so a Git repository nested inside a larger multi-repository checkout resolves to the intended root, with submodules and worktrees covered.
- Improved headless `-p` runs so the agent settles a choice itself where it would otherwise ask, instead of stalling on a question nobody is there to answer.
- Improved the `schedule` tool by dropping the redundant `Timer Cancelled` notification when a one-shot timer with an early-termination condition is cancelled, and by naming both the condition and the exact sender whose message satisfied it in the step result.
- Improved file paths in tool step lines by collapsing your home directory to `~` instead of truncating the front of the path, so the interesting end of a long path stays on screen.
- Fixed `--mode` being ignored in headless `-p` runs, where a valid value such as `accept-edits` or `plan` was never applied and an unrecognized value produced no warning at all.
- Fixed startup diagnostics being swallowed into the log file instead of reaching the terminal, including crash notices, the `--conversation` not-found warning, the `--print` and `--prompt-interactive` conflict, conversation load errors, and the `--mode` and `--agent` warnings.
- Fixed a character disappearing from your submitted prompt where it wrapped at the terminal's right edge, caused by the echoed prompt being indented after it had already been wrapped to the full width.
- Fixed file citations in a response losing their line numbers, so a cited range renders as `path:10-25` again instead of just the file name.
- Fixed a write-in answer in a multi-select question discarding the boxes you had already ticked, and fixed a stale write-in being submitted after you went back to a predefined option.
- Fixed large background tasks crowding out the prompt by limiting each active item below the input box to a single line.
- Fixed corruption of `config.json` by writing user config atomically, so a crash or a concurrent writer can no longer leave a truncated file that silently breaks settings persistence.
- Fixed the CLI giving up on a slow OS keyring after one second and falling back to empty storage, which forced a re-login; it now waits five seconds, as every other keyring operation already did.
- Fixed conversation preview titles derived from the first user message by cutting them at the first line and capping them at 500 characters, so a large pasted or scripted prompt no longer produces a multi-megabyte stored title.
- Fixed a crash on Windows when resolving the conversation transcript path, by honoring the path's drive letter in the trajectory log artifact converter.
- Fixed a subagent going silent on its parent when its own message failed to send, and fixed the parent being handed an empty notice when a subagent went idle without a final response.
- Fixed the `read_url_content` tool leaking a connection on every call, which could eventually exhaust the machine's available ports.
- Fixed the status line reporting model quota that was always one fetch out of date, so it now matches the quota you actually have left.

## 1.1.11

- Added a Vim editing mode, off by default and switched on from `/settings` under `Editor Mode`, bringing modal editing to the prompt with Normal, Insert, Visual and Visual Line modes, a mode badge in the status line and a Vim tab in `/help`, and covering the `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `w`/`b`/`e` and `W`/`B`/`E` motions, the `0`/`^`/`$`/`gg`/`G` boundaries, the `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` character searches with their `;` and `,` repeats, the `i`/`a`/`I`/`A` insert entries, the `d`/`c`/`y` operators alongside `x`, `D` and `C` filling the unnamed register for `p`, and the `iw`/`aw`/`iW`/`aW`/`ip`/`ap` text objects.
- Added Vim-aware submission so a prompt can be sent without leaving modal editing, through an `Editor Mode > Insert First` toggle that opens the prompt in Insert mode where a bare `Enter` submits and a modified key such as `shift+enter` or `ctrl+j` inserts a newline, `ctrl+s` and `ctrl+enter` keys that submit from Normal mode, an `Enter` binding available as `vim.insert.submit`, and the full set of `vim.*` scopes in `keybindings.json` for remapping any of it.
- Added Vim editing to the comment editors in the diff and artifact-detail views, whose footer hints follow the active mode rather than showing one fixed set of bindings, and made a collapsed block behave as a single unit under Vim motions.
- Added non-interactive answers for the read-only slash commands in print mode, so `-p "/usage"`, `/quota`, `/credits`, `/model`, `/effort` and `/skills` emit one tab-separated record per line — or a structured payload under `--output-format json` and `stream-json` — without starting an agent turn, spending quota, or leaving a conversation behind.
- Added an explicit refusal for the remaining interactive-only slash commands in print mode, which previously fell through as literal prompt text and let the model answer as though the command had run, so `-p "/clear"` reported the context cleared while nothing was cleared; each now fails with the flag or subcommand that replaces it.
- Improved plugin enable and disable so `config.json` is the only place enablement lives, seeded once from each plugin's manifest, which stops a plugin that later ships `"disabled": true` from switching itself off under someone who was already running it and stops a shipped-default change from moving every user on the next release.
- Improved the artifact detail view by wrapping long lines in code files instead of clipping them at the right edge.
- Improved model retries by honoring the server-supplied retry delay instead of the client's own backoff, so a retry after a rate limit or an overload waits exactly as long as the server asks.
- Improved model-loading errors so a permission failure such as a missing license or a missing IAM role is shown as itself, with a troubleshooting link, instead of a generic failure during the run.
- Fixed an allowlist entry that tokenizes to zero command words — `command(time)`, a comment-only entry, or an empty compound such as `()` — matching every command and silently auto-approving anything the agent ran; such an entry now matches nothing.
- Fixed commands being auto-approved while the session was in request-review or strict permission mode.
- Fixed admin controls being skipped for MCP servers at startup, where a fetch made before authentication cached "admin controls not applicable" and allowed every server for the next five minutes, and fixed the built-in Chrome DevTools MCP server being blocked outright by admin controls.
- Fixed MCP progress callbacks being dropped and the task log file not being initialized, so long-running MCP tool calls report progress again.
- Fixed a slash command receiving the collapsed `[Pasted text #N]` placeholder instead of the pasted content when its argument was pasted into the prompt.
- Fixed the prompt saving the typed prefix rather than the completed command name to history when an autocompleted slash command was submitted, so up-arrow recall replays what actually ran, and made an alias require an exact match before auto-executing so a partial alias fills the prompt instead of running a command you did not finish typing.
- Fixed an asynchronous settings refresh re-enabling the feedback survey partway through a print-mode run that had switched it off.
- Fixed spurious "Out of credits" errors, where an empty credits response was read as a balance of zero.
- Fixed the "Use AI Credits" setting being offered to accounts signed in through a Google Cloud project or application default credentials, where it does not apply.

## 1.1.10

- Added Business sign-in for Gemini Enterprise accounts, so you can authenticate with a Google Cloud project under Google Cloud terms, use a license seat allocated or auto-assigned from your organization's GE-Standard or GE-Plus subscription, run inference in a chosen region, and have your organization's administrator controls applied to various features.
- Added Workforce Identity Federation sign-in for enterprise users, available as the `Use advanced SSO config` option on the Google Cloud sign-in screen, so organizations that federate identity through an external provider can authenticate with their own identity provider.
- Added sign-in with Application Default Credentials so you can use Agent Platform.
- Added a non-blocking advisory banner when the same conversation is already open in another CLI instance on the same machine, pointing at `/fork` so two sessions no longer interleave writes into one trajectory.
- Improved the terminal sandbox by granting read-only rather than writable access to a Git repository's `.git` directory, so the agent can inspect repository metadata without being able to rewrite it from inside the sandbox.
- Improved hook ordering so hooks defined in `hooks.json` run before the built-in termination checks, which lets `PostInvocation` hooks observe the final invocation of a turn and lets `Stop` hooks run at all instead of sitting unreachable behind the built-ins.
- Improved the `schedule` tool to accept `DurationSeconds` and `MaxIterations` when a model emits them as bare JSON numbers rather than strings, accepting integral values and rejecting non-integral ones with a clear error instead of failing the call.
- Fixed `--model` and `--effort` being ignored in interactive sessions and in headless `-p` runs, where the flags were applied after model configuration had already been initialized so the run silently fell back to the persisted or default model.
- Fixed a bare `--effort` resolving against the default model instead of the model you actually have selected, which could silently move you to a different model.
- Fixed stopping a subagent tree stopping only the conversation it was invoked from, while every descendant subagent and the background tasks they owned kept running and the CLI still reported them as killed.
- Fixed a forced-continuation deadlock where a coordinator waiting on active subagents or background tasks would loop injecting empty continue steps until it hit the invocation limit, wasting tokens and blocking progress.
- Fixed the spacebar not toggling an option in multi-select prompts, including the `ask_question` dialog and the onboarding import checkbox, which left `x` as the only working toggle; the hint bar now advertises it.
- Fixed the Left and Right arrow keys being captured to navigate the input box suggestion dropdown, so you can move the cursor and edit text again while suggestions are showing.
- Fixed the model picker's "No models available" state rendering without its header and footer, so it now shows the standard chrome and an `esc` hint to go back.
- Fixed tools that an MCP server marks to always run in the background executing as blocking calls that stalled the turn.
- Fixed an MCP process leak when a server connection dropped unexpectedly.
- Fixed the artifact viewer corrupting plain documents by horizontally clipping every document rather than only the diagram artifacts that need it.
- Fixed the sandbox not recording blocked network requests when the command itself exited successfully, which hid the fact that a request had been denied.

## 1.1.9

- Added slash-command and skill expansion to print mode, so a headless run such as `-p "/my-skill review this diff"` now resolves and applies the skill instead of sending it as literal text, with `--disable-slash-commands` to opt out.
- Improved interactive startup so a slow or hanging MCP server no longer stalls the first agent turn, loading MCP servers in the background for the interactive session while headless and one-shot runs keep blocking so their single scripted turn still sees the full toolset.
- Improved permission grants so a pattern approved at a prompt is recorded for the rest of the conversation, letting later commands that match it run without prompting again.
- Improved the default system temporary-directory grant to cover writes as well as reads, so agents no longer trigger a permission prompt when creating or updating files there.
- Fixed stop hooks that always block hanging the agent forever; after a configurable number of consecutive continuations, the hook can no longer block and the turn ends normally.
- Fixed `PostToolUse` hooks firing on non-tool steps such as user input and model responses, which also caused them to ignore their configured matchers.
- Fixed slash commands not being recognized when separated from their arguments by a newline or tab, so a prompt starting with a command followed by a newline is now parsed as a command instead of being sent verbatim.
- Fixed deleting into a collapsed paste placeholder removing one character at a time, which left a visible fragment in the prompt while the full pasted content was still submitted; the block is now deleted atomically.
- Fixed the artifact viewer losing syntax highlighting when returning from the editor view, and returning to the wrong panel when exiting the artifact detail view.
- Fixed the headless `stream-json` `init` event advertising tools that are not available in your build.
- Fixed MCP servers forcing a full re-authentication after a dropped connection.

## 1.1.8

- Print mode (`-p` / `--print`) now supports structured, machine-readable output via the `--output-format` flag (`text` (default), `json`, or `stream-json`), so headless runs in CI, eval harnesses, and scripts can consume the CLI's output programmatically; these flags are now discoverable in `--help`.
- Added the `stream-json` output format: a strongly-typed NDJSON event stream that emits typed `init`, `step_update`, and terminal `result` events with a stable, closed-vocabulary `step_type` discriminator, so consumers receive progress incrementally instead of waiting for the whole run to finish.
- Added the `--json-schema` flag to enforce a custom JSON schema on the structured output, accepting either an inline schema string or a path to a schema file; for `stream-json` the schema applies to the final `result` event.
- Enriched the structured stream with a `tool_info` object for each tool call (canonical tool name, parameters, and output) and a `subagent_info` payload for delegated subagents (including `conversation_id` and `log_uri`) so consumers can correlate child trajectories.
- The JSON usage object emitted by `json` and `stream-json` now reports token accounting including `cache_read_tokens`, so non-interactive consumers can attribute prompt-cache hits.
- Added a `copyOnSelect` setting (default on, toggleable in `/settings`) that controls whether releasing a mouse text-selection auto-copies it to the system clipboard in the TUI's altscreen rendering mode; disable it to stop the automatic copy on release — useful when the auto-copy is unwanted or corrupts certain payloads.
- Improved compound-command permissions so an exact chained command (such as `git fetch && git rebase`) can be saved as an allow-always rule and no longer re-prompts on the next identical run.

## 1.1.7

- Improved permission prompts for compound shell commands so the full command is shown when any part of it needs approval.
- Fixed disabled plugins still running their hooks and contributing other customizations, which could keep a broken hook active and break file-editing tools even after the plugin was turned off.
- Fixed MCP OAuth against providers that do not strictly follow the spec (such as Salesforce and Atlassian) by relaxing issuer validation and including the `refresh_token` grant.
- Fixed `/btw` failing with a "parent conversation not found" error when used as the very first action in a fresh session.
- Fixed clipboard corruption of CJK and other non-ASCII text when copying on Windows.
- Fixed print mode (`-p`) sending a prompt before the account-eligibility check finished, which let ineligible accounts bypass the check the interactive UI enforces.

## 1.1.6

- Custom Agents (Markdown Format). Added support for defining custom agents using Markdown files (`agent.md`) with YAML frontmatter and H1-delimited system prompts. Markdown agents support `mainAgent`, `subagent`, `hidden`, `inheritMcp`, and `commandExecutionPolicy` frontmatter fields for fine-grained control over agent behavior. Dynamically defined subagents (via `define_subagent`) now also write Markdown format so they resolve correctly on external builds.
- Added an optional index argument to `/copy` so `/copy <n>` copies the n-th most recent response to the clipboard, while `/copy` and `/copy 1` still copy the latest.
- Improved `/codesearch` to render results progressively as they stream in, showing a live count while loading and letting you cancel an in-flight search with `Esc` instead of blocking until the whole search finishes.
- Improved default file access by granting read access to the system temporary directory out of the box, resolved correctly per platform, so agents no longer trigger permission prompts when reading temporary files.
- Improved support for markdown-based custom agents so custom agent management and selection behave more consistently.
- Improved customization discovery by sorting rules and discovered paths deterministically, preventing unstable prompt ordering and needless prompt-cache misses.
- Improved overall reliability and stability across the CLI with additional hardening and fixes for intermittent failures in background tasks, print mode, and interactive flows.
- Fixed switching from a custom agent back to the default agent via `/agents`, which previously failed silently and left the conversation stuck on the custom agent's persona.
- Fixed a crash when a command was blocked by sandbox permissions before its output was captured, and cleaned up the permission approval and denial messages.
- Fixed the artifact viewer emitting garbage escape bytes when cycling to image mode on terminals that are detected but cannot actually render Kitty graphics, such as iTerm2.
- Fixed the first keystroke (such as `Esc`) being dropped when opening the first artifact view on some non-Kitty terminals.
- Fixed conversation jitter and a stranded input box during streaming so transient markdown reflow no longer shifts the pending line and input box upward.
- Fixed print mode (`-p`) surfacing the real conversation-creation failure instead of a misleading "no active conversation" error.
- Fixed the message list dropping its header when rewinding or resetting conversation steps.
- Fixed a background auto-updater double-spawn race where two processes could each spawn an updater within a single update window.
- Fixed sandbox error reporting so blocked actions are recorded even when the network proxy is disabled.
- Fixed the screen going blank after the authentication page.
- Fixed the `ctrl+b` shortcut being hardcoded to background shell commands even when none were running, so a remapped `ctrl+b` is now respected whenever there are no running shell commands in the conversation.

## 1.1.5

- Added a `/effort` command to view and change the current model's reasoning effort, with a left/right timeline-gauge picker and a direct `/effort <level>` form so you can trade latency for depth on the fly.
- Added an `--effort` flag to select a model's reasoning-effort variant when launching the CLI.
- Added stable, user-facing model slugs that appear in the `/model` picker and are accepted by `--model`, so you can pin a specific model reliably across sessions.
- Added a `model` option to custom agent frontmatter so an agent runs at a chosen model tier (such as `flash` or `pro`) when invoked as a subagent, defaulting to `inherit` (the parent's model).
- Redesigned the `/model` picker to group models by their base model and choose reasoning effort from a timeline gauge navigable with Left and Right, and added an effort badge to the status line for models that expose multiple effort variants.
- Improved the `/settings` (`/config`) panel by making it a bounded, scrollable list so it renders correctly in short terminals instead of overflowing, and stopped it from flickering when opening and closing dropdowns.
- Improved background-task reliability by moving long-running work onto a shared lifecycle with deterministic startup and shutdown and panic-safe launching, so a failure in one background task no longer disrupts the session and pending analytics are flushed on exit instead of dropped.
- Improved responsiveness of bursty background refreshes by coalescing rapid repeated triggers into a single run, cutting redundant work.
- Fixed a crash when triggering Authenticate on a remote MCP server in the `/mcp` panel.
- Fixed MCP tool results containing embedded resources being silently dropped, so text and inline media returned by MCP servers now surface in the conversation.
- Fixed permission checks splitting a single command into a pipeline when an argument contained quoted shell metacharacters (such as `--grep="a|b"`), which caused spurious permission prompts.
- Fixed the file-view and file-search tools failing with invalid-UTF-8 errors when a multi-byte character was split at a truncation boundary.
- Fixed a data race when collecting customization rules by guarding the shared structures.

 ## 1.1.4

- Added support for stacking multiple leading slash commands in a single prompt, so a chain like `/plan /grill-me <prompt>` parses, activates, and renders every command in the order you typed them.
- Improved scrolling in the `/diff` viewer so paging through a diff no longer jitters or pushes the status line off the screen when lines wrap or comments expand.
- Fixed custom agents that declare `subagent: false` still appearing in the available-subagents list and being invocable as subagents.
- Fixed headless (`-p` / `--print`) runs so they now honor persisted `settings.json` policies, including `permissions`, file access, sandbox mode, auto-execution, and artifact review.
- Fixed `/btw` side-questions leaking into the conversation list as duplicate entries that carried the parent conversation's title.
- Fixed the prompt to honor a custom Enter binding to `prompt.insert_newline`, so a remapped Enter inserts a newline instead of submitting.
- Fixed eligibility error messages so the CLI shows the real reason again instead of defaulting to a generic "unknown reason".

## 1.1.3

- Added a `/codesearch` command (aliases `/cs` and `/search`) to interactively search code across your workspace, interpreting queries as regex by default with `-F`/`--literal` for exact matching and `f:`/`file:` globs to include or exclude paths.
- Added copy-on-select in no-flickering mode so dragging highlights text and releasing the mouse copies the ANSI-stripped selection to the clipboard, and hides the virtual scrollbar so it no longer interferes with copying multi-line output.
- Added an indicator at each context-compaction boundary so you can see where earlier compaction happened.
- Improved interactive startup latency by loading skills asynchronously so the CLI no longer blocks on a synchronous, filesystem-heavy skill-discovery pass during bring-up.
- Improved eligibility error handling by showing errors with a verification URL inline in the input loop instead of stacking them above the screen.
- Improved customization loading latency for skills, rules, agents, and hooks by consolidating directory walks and caching filesystem lookups to cut redundant I/O during discovery.
- Removed the padding spaces around inline code for tighter rendering.
- Fixed code-block corruption where `$..$` math expansion desynced from the Markdown parser and mangled fenced shell snippets such as `git fetch "$GIT_REMOTE"` by detecting fenced code blocks line-by-line.
- Fixed headless (`-p`) runs hanging or silently auto-approving tools that require a permission confirmation, so the CLI now soft-denies such tools and prints a stderr notice naming the allow-rule needed to permit them.
- Fixed outside-of-workspace file writes being incorrectly auto-approved in always-proceed mode.
- Fixed high CPU and unbounded render cost on large conversations in no-flickering mode by making index rebuilds idempotent so the conversation index converges instead of growing on every rebuild.
- Fixed lingering artifact comments after dismissing the artifact detail view and corrected no-flickering-mode row math so the status line renders correctly within the viewport.
- Fixed repeated sign-in prompts on Linux caused by the OS keyring: the CLI now bypasses the keyring when no D-Bus session bus is present (headless hosts and containers), skips it for an hour after a timeout, and uses longer keyring timeouts so a slow-but-successful credential read is no longer cut short and forced into a fresh login.
- Fixed MCP servers hanging the agent indefinitely when a server never responds by bounding connection, tool-listing, and per-tool-call attempts with timeouts.
- Fixed conversations breaking after certain tool calls, which previously corrupted the conversation history and blocked all further responses.
- Fixed customization rules being loaded twice when a rules directory is reachable through a symlink.

## 1.1.2

- Added an `f` (full diff) shortcut to the create-file tool review screen so new-file confirmations can open a full-screen diff view, matching the existing file-edit experience.
- Added support for pasting the OAuth authorization code in print mode (-p) via the controlling terminal (/dev/tty on POSIX and CONIN$ on Windows) when stdin is consumed by a piped prompt, and made truly headless runs fail fast with an actionable message instead of blocking.
- Improved responsiveness on large conversations (5000+ steps) in no flickering mode by switching hot-path line-count methods to pointer receivers, cutting the per-frame prefix-sum cost and eliminating sustained 99% CPU and keystroke lag.
- Fixed print mode silently downgrading to the default model when --model cannot be resolved by hard-failing with a non-zero exit and listing the available models, while interactive sessions keep the fallback-with-warning behavior.
- Fixed permission checks not respecting the allowlist for nested command substitutions, so a command like echo "$(dirname $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))" now runs without prompting when echo and git are allowlisted, instead of double-counting the nested command and prompting for review.
- Fixed the CLI keybindings file staying out of sync with /keybindings when new default bindings are introduced by persisting the injected defaults while preserving user overrides.
- Fixed garbled builtin tool headers such as CodeSearch(4 files found...) by mapping generic tool steps back to clean summaries like Read(/path) and CodeSearch(query).
- Fixed mcp manager failing to resolve tool schema paths in standalone mode and leaking MCP server subprocesses after shutdown, which previously caused panics and cleanup failures for custom agents loading MCP tools.
- Fixed a data race and copy-on-write violation when updating subagent states by cloning their stats before in-place mutation, preventing corrupted step counts and status for parallel subagents.

## 1.1.1

- Added the `--agent` flag and `agent/agents` subcommand, allowing users to select a custom agent at launch and list available agents.
- Added in-file keyword search (`/`) and jump navigation (`n/N`) to the artifact detail viewer, allowing users to find and cycle through matches without disrupting terminal escape sequences or image grids.
- Fixed print mode (`--print` / `-p`) silently exiting with a success code and empty output when a request failed server-side, now writing the error to stderr and returning a non-zero exit code.
- Fixed `agy -p` hanging when run inside a shell script or subprocess by no longer reading stdin when a prompt is provided via a flag.
- Fixed a data race on the `/btw` cancellation function.
- Added support for displaying nested subagents (grandchild and deeper) and handling tool confirmation requests across all subagent depths by recursively relaying nested subtrajectory updates to the root conversation.
- Changed the default mode to respect write_file permissions allowlisted in `settings.json` under `permission.allow`, so pre-approved file writes no longer prompt for review.
- Changed the default name for the newly initialized project to `CLI Project` for clearer workspace identification.
- Improved the session exit output by placing the resume command on its own line, making it easier to copy and paste in terminals and tools like tmux.
- Fixed interactive `/diff` viewer defects in Jujutsu (jj) workspaces by correctly prioritizing `.jj` over `.git` in colocated repos, fixing commit hash regex boundaries, and correctly highlighting active `@` graph nodes.
- Fixed workspace-local hooks defined in `<workspace>/.agents/hooks.json` not loading after trusting a folder by reloading hooks whenever workspaces change.
- Fixed misaligned markdown tables containing file links in chat output.

## 1.1.0

- Agent execution mode cycling is now publicly available: `default` -> `accept-edits` -> `plan`)
- Added `request-review` (default) mode as the default execution behavior: automatically pauses before file write operations to display an interactive, line-level diff preview (`f` shortcut) where users can review, accept, or reject individual code modifications before they are saved to disk.
- Added an `Agent Mode` option to the `/settings` panel so users can set and persist a default execution mode (`default`, `accept-edits`, `plan`) without manually editing `settings.json` or passing `--mode` on startup, with real-time synchronization so changes take effect immediately.
- Added a dedicated `"Create file"` confirmation preview for new file creations (`write_to_file` without overwrite): renders new content as an addition-only diff preview.
- Added `/plan` mode to replace legacy `/planning`, and removed `/fast` slash commands: consolidated and simplified execution mode switching around `shift+tab` mode cycling and the `/plan` mode prefix
- Improved file-edit diff preview rendering: computed accurate line-level diffs with context lines (`3` lines) and hunk separators, capped inline preview height with truncation hints, and added a comment confirmation prompt when exiting the diff view with unsent comments.
- Improved UI footer keybinding hints across all panels (such as `/tasks`, `/agents`, `/permissions`, and `/mcp`) by replacing hardcoded hint strings with centralized layout helpers that dynamically respect customized global and local keybinding configurations (`keybindings.json`).
- Improved the multiline conversation rename view in the `/resume` picker by dynamically adjusting input box width and padding, and right-aligning metadata columns (`workspace`, `steps`, `time`) on the top line to prevent horizontal scrolling or layout shifts during active renaming.
- Fixed the tool confirmation dialog to accurately check normalized file URIs against active workspace directories, resolving an issue where valid in-workspace file creations and reads were incorrectly flagged with an `"Reason: outside workspace"` warning.
- Fixed workspace initialization failures when launching the CLI inside dot-prefixed directories (such as  .parent_dir/project ) by scoping path exclusion filters strictly to relative paths inside the workspace rather than rejecting dot-prefixed ancestor directories.
- Fixed the `/agents` view header displaying `agent.json` instead of `agent.md` when creating new subagents.
- Fixed the `/agents` panel's `"Create New Agents"` section displaying the wrong global configuration directory (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` instead of `~/.gemini/config/`), ensuring users create global subagents in the location actively scanned during startup discovery.
- Fixed statusline shortcut hints (`? for shortcuts`) and redundant escape hints (`Esc to cancel`) erroneously appearing inside full-screen overlay panels (such as `/changelog`, `/artifact`, and `/settings`) by correctly tracking overlay panel states.
- Fixed inconsistent timestamp formatting in the `/tasks` panel and task detail views by converting agent-initiated background task timestamps (`time.Time`) from UTC to the local timezone.

## 1.0.16

- Improved the `/tasks` detail panel to automatically scroll to the bottom as new background task logs stream in, and default to the latest output when opened while preserving scroll position if scrolled up manually.
- Improved model generation resilience by adding automatic client-side retries when encountering transient errors.
- Fixed dynamically defined subagents by transitioning definitions from JSON to Markdown format, fixing an issue where dynamically created subagents failed to invoke.
- Fixed a crash occurring when executing background tasks or terminal commands that produce empty outputs (such as `sleep`).
- Fixed shutdown resource leaks by integrating the shared SQLite summary store for background synchronization and resolving goroutine and database connection leaks on CLI exit.
- Fixed a permission manager hook error by safely handling empty decision strings returned by pre-tool hooks instead of failing with an "unknown pre-tool hook decision" error.

## 1.0.15

- Introduced a new interactive status indicator below the input box that displays active subagents and background tasks in real-time, making it easy to monitor and navigate parallel workflows at a glance.
- Added `ctrl+g` on the artifact view to open $EDITOR. Also added a warning confirmation prompt before opening the editor in the artifact detail view if there are unsent comments, and ensured these comments are preserved upon reload if the artifact content was not modified.
- Added `alt+v` as an alternative paste shortcut on Windows to resolve issues where ctrl+v is intercepted by the terminal emulator, enabling reliable image pasting.
- Improved the `/permissions` panel to dynamically reload configurations from disk and prevent accidental overwrites.
- Increased the MCP connection timeout to 60 seconds to improve reliability for slow-starting custom MCP servers.
- Fixed a bug on Windows where print mode and other non-TUI command outputs were silently discarded when run in non-TTY environments (such as pipes or subprocesses).
- Fixed Windows editor fallback to use "edit" or "notepad" when the editor setting is "auto" and no editor is configured, instead of attempting to use "vim".
- Fixed the subagent approval TUI to dynamically render user-defined custom keybindings (such as alternative approval keys) instead of showing hardcoded defaults.
- Fixed alignment and wrapping issues in the comment editor for multiline comments, ensuring all lines are indented consistently.

## 1.0.14

- Allowed image pasting from the clipboard in local tmux sessions.
- Removed the max limit for the `/goal` command, allowing goals to run indefinitely until completed or cancelled.
- Enabled "always proceeds" mode for subagents to auto approve artifacts, preventing them from hanging when the parent is blocked.
- Fixed plugin import logic to copy the entire plugin directory, preventing it from stripping non-skill directories (like `shared/`).
- Fixed an MCP configuration path mismatch in the CLI and permission manager to ensure reliable custom MCP server loading.
- Fixed a TUI layout race condition caused by stale input state in the conversation model.
- Fixed a bug where the inline viewport was not properly reset after a conversation rewind.

## 1.0.13

- Fixed a bug where the CLI would temporarily render skill commands without their slash prefix during optimistic updates by deferring prefix stripping to the serialization boundary, ensuring the UI always displays exactly what the user typed.
- Fixed a redundant CLI exit message by removing the "Resume in the same project" hint line, leaving only the standard resume command to simplify exit output.
- Resolved bugs during UI transitions (such as opening subagent details or logging out) by introducing a unified synchronization mechanism that prevents key lockups and ensures overlay panels like the /help view are properly reset.
- Improved command permission security by making "Always Approve" rule matching strict (non-regex) by default, while allowing users to explicitly opt-in to regex matching by prepending rules with `regex:`.
- Improved command permission usability by relaxing redirection checks, allowing safe commands with output redirection (e.g., `tool > file`) to match without requiring strict full-command approval.
- Fixed a bug in the CLI prompt editor where undo and redo history stacks could become desynchronized during rapid mutations by decoupling the history state into a unified, pointer-backed structure.
- Fixed a bug where browser-related prompt sections were missing from the agent's prompt registry, ensuring browser-based tasks execute reliably.

## 1.0.12

- Added support for `--project` and `--new-project` launch flags to allow users to explicitly set or create projects, and updated the project resolution logic to default regardless of the active workspace.
- Added a confirmation prompt when pressing `Esc` in comment mode with unsaved modifications to prevent users from accidentally discarding their work in review views.
- Added dynamic OSC8 terminal hyperlink support to render clickable links in supporting terminals, with automatic fallback stripping for backward compatibility.
- Introduced reverse diff cycling navigation mapped to `shift+n` in unified diff review mode to allow users to easily cycle backwards through diff blocks.
- Improved permission config merging priorities by ensuring project-specific configurations (located in `~/.gemini/config/projects/`) take precedence over global settings in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`.
- Fixed a regression where `ctrl+o` scrollback clearing failed by restoring the use of cached fields rather than shared pointer comparisons for trajectory toggle detection.
- Fixed a rendering bug where Makefile syntax (like `$(call ...)`) inside code blocks was mistakenly parsed and mangled by LaTeX math expansion, by introducing a state machine that restricts expansion to prose segments.
- Fixed an enterprise network connectivity issue by restoring AES-NI compile-time optimizations, which prevents Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) firewalls from incorrectly flagging and resetting TLS connections.
- Fixed incorrect key strings by removing the unsupported backtab default binding and correcting invalid `pgdn` references to `pgdown` to align with Bubble Tea v2 canonical names.

## 1.0.11

- Added `ctrl+c` as an exit and interrupt key: the first press cancels active agent operations (like streaming responses), and a double-press triggers the exit flow. Also added a dynamic exit hint in the status line.
- Fixed `ctrl+d` behavior to act as a forward-delete when the input prompt contains text, only triggering the exit flow when the prompt is empty.
- Improved `/resume` loading performance by implementing a persistent metadata cache and parallel loader, eliminating severe latency with large conversation histories and preventing background loading log spam.
- Added an expanded AltScreen view for tool confirmations (accessible via `ctrl+g`), allowing users to view and edit the full command and associated permissions in a dedicated full-screen view, replacing the inline edit (`e`) key.
- Added the `AGY_CLI_CMD_OUTPUT_PERCENTAGE` environment variable, allowing users to customize the maximum height of command outputs in the TUI as a percentage of the terminal height.
- Added strict key name validation to the keybindings system to reject invalid key names (like typos) and suggest canonical alternatives, preventing "dead keys" from being registered.
- Added a validation warning when `ctrl+c` is mapped to a non-default action, clarifying that the system always intercepts `ctrl+c` to interrupt active operations or exit, and providing instructions on how to resolve the warning.
- Improved command output rendering by making the output height dynamic, improving the readability of commands like `/keybindings`.
- Improved text rendering with ANSI-aware word wrapping at word boundaries and prevented URLs containing hyphens from being incorrectly split across lines.
- Improved the `/resume` experience: added support for pasting clipboard text into the search filter and rename fields, upgraded the rename input to a multiline editor to prevent long titles from being hidden, and fixed a bug where the navigation cursor could disappear.
- Improved keybinding validation warning messages to use user-facing names (e.g., `cli.escape`) instead of internal representation names.
- Improved startup behavior by only creating the `keybindings.json` configuration file when the user explicitly runs the `/keybindings` customization command, rather than automatically generating it on every startup.
- Improved keybinding error presentation by replacing the persistent error footer with transient error alerts, freeing up valuable terminal space.
- Fixed the `ctrl+c` exit safety valve to ensure it always works as an interrupt or exit key, regardless of how it is mapped in the user's custom keybindings configuration.
- Fixed VCS commit tree rendering to reserve the `@` marker exclusively for the actual current commit in the VCS history rather than the synthetic "Working Copy" entry, helping users easily identify the working copy parent.
- Fixed authentication error handling to gracefully handle unsigned-in states by returning an empty configuration and suppressing noisy error logs.

## 1.0.10

- Improved compatibility with a broader set of ARM64 devices (e.g. raspberry pi 4b).
- Added `antigravity_guide` builtin skill to provide instant, in-context reference guides for the Antigravity 2.0, CLI, IDE, and SDK.
- Improved commit history navigation: scrolling now immediately loads and displays changed files and diffs.
- Improved Git integration by enabling ASCII node graphs (`git log --graph`) for visual parity with hg/jj.
- Improved commit hash matching to seamlessly resolve short (6-char) to long (64-char) hashes via prefix comparison.
- Added alert message type for system errors/warnings, separating them from standard command output.
- Added the CLI log file path to the `/help` menu for easy troubleshooting.
- Improved markdown rendering by upgrading `glamour` to v2.0.1 for cleaner headings and block padding.
- Improved authentication to automatically launch browser sign-in via `rundll32`.
- Fixed a bug where "ask" permissions were dropped during settings updates, ensuring `settings.json` preservation.
- Fixed permission engine matching bugs by escaping regex metacharacters (like `$` or `.`) in saved rules, preventing infinite prompt loops.
- Fixed environment flag parsing to prevent ignored disablement flags.
- Fixed bash mode argument escaping (preventing swallowed stdout) and defaulted shell resolution to PowerShell.

## 1.0.9

- Added submodule support for plugins installation. External plugin installation now automatically resolves and initializes Git submodules.
- Optimized customizations permissions: Automatically grants read-only access to the builtin customizations directory, eliminating redundant permission prompts on startup.
- Improved glamour parser error handling (like nested checkboxes inside list emphasis) and preventing it from crashing the TUI, falling back to raw text with a warning banner.
- Updated bubbletea to v2.0.7: Resolves a potential TUI panic when terminal input is unavailable, fixes a data race in mouse handling within the Cursed Renderer, and corrects mouse release behavior under the Kitty Keyboard protocol.
- Hardened command execution permission checks by enforcing strict exact-match verification for PowerShell scripts, complex shell redirections ( `>` , `2>&1` ), and unparseable strings to prevent sandbox escapes.
- Hardened sandbox execution by adding `.git` to the core list of dangerous paths, preventing unauthorized or destructive repository modifications.
- Fixed a bug where allowlisted terminal commands with quoted arguments (e.g., `python -c "print(1)"`) would silently fail to match at runtime due to flawed whitespace tokenization.
- Fixed a bug in headless print mode resumption (`--conversation`/`-c` `-p ...`) where the CLI would dump the entire historical conversation transcript instead of only printing the newly generated response.
- Fixed a CPU compatibility issue on ARM64 devices without AES hardware support.

## 1.0.8

- Added support for capturing slash command history, allowing users to use the up arrow to replay previously entered slash commands.
- Redesigned the "Models & Quota" page (enabled by default, replacing the legacy usage page) to gracefully handle disabled quota buckets by displaying a dimmed "Disabled" status and omitting the progress bar.
- Added display of quota usage and execution mode in the status line.
- Improved `/btw` to be more token efficient and support streaming responses for a smoother user experience and fixed premature truncation.
- Fixed a bug where the `/hooks` command wrote configurations to `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/hooks.json` instead of the shared `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`, ensuring hooks remain synchronized between the TUI and the backend.
- Fixed a CPU compatibility issue (SIGILL on non-AES-NI CPUs), preventing immediate crashes on startup on older CPUs (like Intel Ivy Bridge) or VM environments that lack AES-NI support.
- Added a per-line guard against extremely long single-line pastes in the TUI prompt editor to prevent performance lag, replacing them with an expandable placeholder.
- Redesigned the `/resume` conversation picker to align the workspace column and added adaptive column dropping (workspace, time, steps) to support narrow terminals.
- Redesigned the `/tasks` list and detail views for better alignment and readability, placing start times on the left, right-aligning status, and capping the panel height.
- Fixed dynamic reloading of custom skills and system slash commands, ensuring they are instantly discovered in autocomplete upon conversation switch or `/add-dir`.
- Improved configuration saving by propagating write failures as transient error flashes on the statusline.
- Improved settings inheritance by ensuring the CLI inherits the `use_ai_credits` setting from global user settings on startup.
- Fixed a TUI hang in the artifact view during long sessions by optimizing the rendering complexity of large step histories.
- Fixed an autocomplete bug where a command that is an exact prefix of another (e.g., `/conv` vs `/conv-switch`) would aggressively auto-complete and hide the suggestions menu.
- Fixed a race condition where sending a message immediately after denying a permission request would fail due to incomplete backend cleanup.
- Fixed potential OOM risks when reading large clipboard files by verifying file size before reading.
- Fixed Windows and Wayland-only Linux distributions clipboard image and file reading.

## 1.0.7

- Added a configurable timeout for launching MCP servers, allowing users to specify a custom timeout or set it to `-1` to disable the timeout completely.
- Revamped the artifact viewer gutter numbering and line mapping to accurately align terminal viewport lines with actual 1-based source file line numbers, including support for wrapped lines and collapsed Mermaid diagrams.
- Fixed a bug where the CLI could get stuck in a pending state (showing a transient spinner) after sending a message due to stale status updates.
- Fixed a bug where the wrong workspace directory was displayed in the header and `/help` menu when multiple workspaces were active.
- Fixed a desync bug in the agent state management where stale callbacks from previous runs could be used upon cache hits in new agent state.
- Fixed Windows-specific sandbox network proxy issues, resolving a hang during connection hijacking and correcting tunnel response protocols.
- Fixed a bug where the archival status timestamp was not correctly saved when archiving conversations.
- Fixed a potential stack overflow crash by introducing a non-recursive warning output mechanism for pre-conversation errors.
- Increased the maximum tool calls limit to 512 for Gemini models, allowing agents to perform significantly more complex, multi-step tasks in a single turn.
- Added support for installing plugins directly from GitHub subpaths (with branch resolution).
- Fixed variable resolution in plugins, ensuring gemini cli variables like `${extensionPath}` correctly resolves to the final installation directory.
- Added native Wayland clipboard support (wl-paste) on Linux, falling back to `xclip` for X11 environments, and prioritized copied files (from file managers) over raw image data.
- Preserved unknown fields in `settings.json` during read, write, and merge operations, preventing settings from being silently wiped out when switching between different CLI versions or builds.
- Fixed layout boundary overflow, scrolling visibility, and out-of-bounds scrolling bugs in the artifact detail view when inline comments are present.

## 1.0.6

- Added shell-style path auto-completion for `/open` and `/add-dir`.
- Added optimistic rendering for user chat prompt submissions, injecting messages immediately into the viewport to eliminate perceived input lag.
- Added fuzzy and partial substring matching across slash commands. E.g. `/el` -> shows `/help` and `/model` while previous no suggested completions.
- Fixed a bug when suggestion was not triggered when `@` is typed after `(`. Enabled unconditional typeahead suggestions whenever `@` is typed without preceding whitespace, streamlining mention workflows.
- Skipped subagent conversations from `/resume`, keeping the standalone conversation picker focused purely on direct user initiated conversations.
- Added a `stack_with_default` flag to the `statusLine` configuration to render both the default Antigravity status line and custom status line output vertically stacked.
- Fixed a bug where entering a prompt immediately after pressing `Esc` (to interrupt an active agent stream) caused the newly typed input to be swallowed or rejected.
- Fixed `--sandbox` flag propagation in headless print mode (`-p` / `--print`), ensuring sandbox isolation is correctly enforced during non-interactive execution.

## 1.0.5

- Added `--model` to set model when launching CLI. Also a new `models` subcommand to list available models.
- Added `/permissions` command which allows to add/edit/remove permissions rules for each of the three configs above directly inside the CLI.
- Allowed opening the Artifact Review panel (shortcut `ctrl+r`) while answering pending questions or tool permission confirmations, preserving your current progress when toggling back.
- Fixed a bug that metadata was written in the current directory as opposed to `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/cache` when running using `-p`.
- Improved statusline layout by merging active tip and artifact status on a single line and truncating with ellipsis on narrow terminals to prevent collisions.
- Improved customization support by allowing directories in the customization manager to be passed as workspace directories, enabling correct trajectory metadata population and `/add-dir` support.
- Added support for `url` in `mcp_config.json` to configure MCP servers directly via a URL.
- Improved `/resume` performance: optimized lazy loading of conversation details, filtered out empty conversations, and added support for scanning SQLite database files (`.db` and `.db-wal`).
- Improved autocomplete: tab completion for slash commands now resolves to the matched alias instead of the primary command name (e.g., `/se` autocompletes to `/settings` instead of `/config`).
- Integrated the permissioning system with the rest of Antigravity. CLI permissions now merges project level permissions, permissions from user settings shared with Antigravity, and permissions from the CLI `settings.json`.

## 1.0.4

- Added SQLite (.db) conversation support and will be CLI’s conversation format. Fixed a bug when importing SQLite conversation from Antigravity 2.0 to CLI.
- Added LaTeX math rendering, enabling the CLI to display beautiful mathematical formulas directly in the terminal viewport. Set `AGY_CLI_DISABLE_LATEX` environment variable to turn off LaTeX rendering globally if desired.
- Decoupled project discovery from local `.antigravitycli` workspace directories. The CLI now stores workspace-to-project mappings in a centralized `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/cache/projects.json` file, eliminating repository clutter and speeding up project discovery to a single-map lookup.
- Resolved sporadic and permanent UI hangs caused by a stateful callback streamer race condition during network drops or extremely fast agent steps.
- Collapses all newlines and consecutive whitespaces in conversation previews and titles before rendering list items, preventing visual UI layout breaks in the picker rows.
- Styled the separator space between the line number column and diff content to match the text blocks, ensuring background highlights stretch seamlessly across the viewport width in tool outputs and `/diff` details.
- Resolved inconsistent behavior where selecting skill-derived slash commands from autocompletion suggestions cleared the input without executing. Autocompleted skill commands are now correctly submitted to the backend.
- Aligned the interactive `/changelog` and `agy changelog` cache paths to both use `antigravity-cli`, and made the caching process synchronous to resolve a race condition where immediate process exit terminated the cache write.
- Moved VCS detection out of the synchronous CLI startup path to prevent slow initialization.
- Resolved an issue where exclusion rules and allowlists configured in rules.json were silently ignored, causing the discovery engine to load every .md rule file unconditionally at boot.
- Parallelized the MCP server initialization sequence, preventing slow or hanging custom MCP servers from blocking independent, fast-starting servers (like local plugins) from loading on startup or configuration reloads.

## 1.0.3

- Added support for G1 credits in the Antigravity CLI. Users can now utilize G1 credits when their standard quota runs out. This includes a new `UseG1Credits` setting to enable automatic credit usage and a real-time display of remaining credits in the status bar.
- Added a new `/credits` panel that provides an in-CLI interface with a direct link to purchase additional G1 credits.
- Fixed an infinite loop in the prompt input. Navigating left (`wordLeft`) when encountering spaces at the very beginning of the input no longer causes an infinite hang.
- Fixed custom MCP server disabling via the TUI. Resolved a directory path mismatch where pressing the `[Disable]` button wrote to the legacy `mcp_config.json` path instead of the migrated `config/mcp_config.json` path, ensuring custom MCP servers can now be successfully disabled and unloaded.
- Redesign CLI logo on Apple Terminal.
- Improved color scheme preview in settings and onboarding: added warnings and thought process examples to the preview, and corrected link styling to only underline the URL.
- Fixed `$EDITOR` environment variable parsing: resolved issues where arguments containing `=` (e.g., `--alternate-editor=vi`) were incorrectly split, causing editor launch failures.
- Fixed `/diff` detail view truncation: implemented dynamic line wrapping based on terminal viewport width and added automatic tab-to-space expansion to prevent layout overflow.
- Fixed project discovery robustness: updated the CLI to skip invalid or broken symlinks in `.antigravitycli/` rather than failing immediately, allowing discovery of valid projects.
- Fixed `AskQuestion` state management: memorizes selected options, write-in values, and UI states when navigating back and forth (`KeyLeft`) between questions in multi-question dialogs.

## 1.0.2

- Added `AGY_CLI_HIDE_ACCOUNT_INFO` environment variable to hide email and plan tier from the header.
- Fixed timeout overrides: restricted the default 60-second interaction timeout specifically to subagents, preventing the main agent from being unconditionally capped.
- Fixed a nil-pointer panic in Sandbox Mode: resolved a typed nil interface comparison when fetching URL content.
- Fixed fallback skill discovery in Standalone mode: ensures custom/fallback skills are successfully loaded even if the standard configuration directory is missing, and added automatic path deduplication to prevent duplicates.
- Fixed command rendering in message history: prefixed slash commands with a caret (`>`) in response block headers to clearly distinguish user-typed commands from agent outputs.
- Fixed plugin installation path mismatch: updated the `plugin` subcommand to install downloaded plugins directly to the shared configuration directory (`~/.gemini/config/`) rather than the private application data folder, making them instantly discoverable.
- Fixed Git short-hash support in diff selection: updated the commit hash recognition pattern in the  /diff  commit selection tree to match Git's standard 7-character short hashes (and up to 40-character full hashes).
- Fixed statusline subcommand handling and recursive loops: added case-insensitive subcommand parsing (help, delete, reset, enable/on, disable/off) to the /statusline command, providing direct control to toggle or revert custom statuslines and blocking recursive shell hangs during help queries.
- Improved `/help` shortcuts tab by sorting shortcuts by keybinding key, adding missing keybindings (like `ctrl+r`, `ctrl+o`, `alt+j`, `ctrl+k`), and generalizing scrolling (PageUp/PageDown/GoToTop/GoToBottom) for both Commands and Shortcuts tabs.

## 1.0.1

- Fixed OAuth token persistence and authentication hangs.
- Fixed Windows log redirection and resizing issues. Resolved a critical bug where logs were not redirected correctly on Windows, which previously caused the terminal to swallow window resize events and shut down slowly.
- Added `proceed-in-sandbox` tool permission mode. Auto-approves terminal commands that run inside the secure sandbox, requesting manual approval only when a command attempts to bypass the sandbox.
- Integrates consumer/free-tier onboarding directly into the CLI.
- Added plugin discovery for skills and agents. Automatically scans installed plugin directories to make custom skills and specialized agents available for execution in the CLI.
- Fixed pasted text line counting. Corrected line counting for user inputs to ensure extremely long inputs are correctly folded into a `[Pasted text #X +Y lines]` placeholder to keep the viewport clean.
- Fixed onboarding stability. Resolved a race condition where a concurrent terminal resize event during onboarding could revert the UI to a blank onboarding screen.
- Moves the **terminal** color scheme to the top of the selection list, making it the default choice during onboarding and in `/settings`.
- Improved `/usage` and `/quota` commands. Forces a real-time reload of model configuration and remaining quotas, allowing you to see updated real-time consumption statistics immediately.
- Improved step rendering layout. Calculates available terminal width dynamically and uses middle-truncation (`/foo/.../bar`) for file path tools to prevent layout shifting on narrow screens.
- Improved session deletion keybinding in `/resume`. Changed the shortcut from `ctrl+d` to `ctrl+delete` to resolve conflicts with the global exit keybinding (`ctrl+d` `ctrl+d`) and preserve Emacs-style forward-delete in search input fields.
- Restored automatic table wrapping, preventing long cells inside markdown tables from being truncated.
- Resolved an issue where deleted files (represented by `+++ /dev/null`) had their deletion lines incorrectly merged into the previous file's diff.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release of the Antigravity CLI.
